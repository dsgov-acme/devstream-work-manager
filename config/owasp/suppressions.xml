        This CVE only covers the fact that H2 CAN be started from the command line with an unencrypted password given
        with a flag, which could leak the password through ps if an attacker gained access to the host. By using
        the embedded version to run tests, we will never expose passwords via this "exploit".

        H2 maintainers have stated they DO NOT consider this a vulnerability and WILL NOT be issuing a fix.

        This CVE covers the possibility that attackers could execute a remote code execution attack when parsing
        untrusted yaml. Spring-boot uses snakeyaml to parse configuration files that are written by developers and
        reviewed in our SCM system.

        Snakeyaml maintainers have stated they DO NOT consider this a vulnerability and WILL NOT be issuing a fix.
